    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Back To Blogging</h2>

<p>Well it's official, I'm starting to blog again. Recently I have been getting back into web
development and in turn spending a lot of time researching and testing new technologies. I have been
away from web development for under a year (I've been more focused on the Dev and DevOps of my
company's cross-platform mobile apps for the last 11-months) and its amazing how much new cool shit
is out. That includes the blogging framework <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress 2.0</a> I am using for this
site.</p>

<h2>Blogging For Tomorrow!</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>The older I get the more Future-Me likes the decisions Past-Me makes. In college, I was just an evil asshole to Future-Me.</p><footer><strong>@AbleCoder</strong> <cite><a href='https://twitter.com/#!/AbleCoder/status/183474986961485824'>twitter.com/#!/AbleCoder/status/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>As nice as it is to explore all these new projects it can be a time consuming process. A lot of that
time spent is NOT playing with or testing the new technology, instead it is spent getting it setup.
I have put many hours into many projects learning how to get a certain technology working. The biggest
problem I have with all this invested time is that it is more often than not, lost. Just a few weeks
(or even days in some cases) of not working with a newly learned technology and I am sure to forget
a lot. This blog is a gift to Future-Me. This blog will document what I already learned so
Future-Me doesn't have to learn it all over again... The slow way.</p>

<p>Hopefully at some point others will find value in my writings but, until then I am perfectly
content writing these articles for that bad-ass, good-looking, Future-Me.</p>

<h2>Until Then...</h2>

<p>No one will see this site (for now anyways) so there is no harm in putting in this <em>codeblock</em> for
testing purposes.</p>
